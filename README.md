## Duskmas: A Collection of Dusk Gameplay Mods
---
This is a CheatEngine table containing scripts meant to alter the behavior of Dusk to customize your experience. To use:

- Download the Cheat Table file
- Load Dusk
- Open CheatEngine
- Hook Dusk
- Load the Cheat Table
- Enable the scripts you want to use

When you're done having fun:
- Close CheatEngine
- Close the game

It's also possible to disable individual mods, but I can't guarantee you that your game will behave nicely after that, even if an effort was made to guarantee that.

*If you don't understand any of these steps, it's likely you shouldn't try using this mod*. The liability for anything that results from using this software is yours and yours alone.

**CheatEngine tables are finnicky and I can't guarantee you their stability or what it'll do to your saves. Treat any savefiles saved with this mod enabled as dirty and tarnished.**
